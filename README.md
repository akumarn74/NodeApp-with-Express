## Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```bash
npm install
bower i
npm install express --save -dev
npm i gulp
npm i express-handlebars
npm i ejs --save -dev
bower install bootstrap --save -dev
npm start // to run the app

```

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 

Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

You're ready to write your application.

We've captured many of the most useful commands in npm scripts defined in the `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode".
